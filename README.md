# Biscuits And Bones

## Overview

Biscuits and Bones, or B&B for short, is a web application which lets pet owners and pet lovers host, attend, and socialize at playdate events tailored for all animals. The goal of B&B is to provide a platform for animal enthusiasts to gather and let their animals let loose and feel more irrelephant (pun intended)!
